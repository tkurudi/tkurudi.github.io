  <h1>c4 daily mindfullness. </h1>
<p>
    What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?I learned that having a netural pose and not fidgeting is a great took to keep things focused and not distracting myself or the other person. i leanred that the tone of my voice is also importaint , because i can tend to sound un-interested when i talk, even though it may be the oppsite. i leanred to respond and not react because sometimes i say what i am immedeatly thinking there and then, since in my world thats the quickest and easyest way to move through a problem or a mistake, however this is not the most 'mindful'way of approching an issue. and also not to et my mind wander and same with the converation, staying on tract is very importaint. 
    Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice? keeping a netural pose, paying attention to my tone of voice and responding not reacting. 
    Any other musings? i wish to keep practicing and learning about these ideas to help me in working environments
