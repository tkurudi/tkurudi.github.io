	What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.a responsive site is a website that reacts to the size of the users screen and also changes the layout of the website to ajust to make everything fit better, this is important because people have different sized screens and all websites to work on all sized screens
 What mobile first design is, and why it's important.i think its a website that is first designed to fit a mobile , so everything is stacked on on top of another (because of the narrow screen) its important becuse its using the idea that mobile sites are harder to create, so if you do it first, it will make everything easier after.
 What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.from works have pre built  code and structure to make a website being built easier. pros are its quicker and a con is that it can be hard to make it unique and is a shortcut ..
 What a wireframe is and why we use it. is a mock up or bones of a website to help the user to design a website before its actually made.
 The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.i initially thought the website was going to be about whatever i wanted , not a remake of my old site, so that was strange
