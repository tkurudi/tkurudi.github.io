            Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go? - Honestly no. It something I need to work on. I keep trust with the people I know and respect and I am strict to that. 
            Try empathic listening - how did it go? - Great tool. I think this is a good tool for leaders and great to build trust with co workers. I tend to forget or - no even care about other peoples problems so this is a good tool.
             How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
           I dont dis like anyone or any thing, I try to empty that from my head and move forward with my life, other wise its draining. - This is a good tool to use if I get caught up with anything negitive in my head.
            Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.
           
            cleaning the tables in a butcher store. - In my life as a chef i have been taught only one way how to clean a bench or - really anything. and I use that technique for everything i clean. 
            -I worked at a butcher store for a few months and I was told off for the way I cleaned, I beleived the way they wanted to clean was wrong, and refused to do it their way and so I left.
           
            -new person with no experience in a butcher cleaning differently to us , its wrong and there is no excuse.
