<h1>questions</h1>
<p> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?
	Pleasure is a strange concept to me. Mostly pleasure should come from me compleating things that I want to do. - But sitting and enjoying the pleasure then makes me counterproductive. - So, I try to keep motivated about thinks that will give me pleasure, otherwise, Im always working. - In my previous life , I found a lot of pleasure in my job. Cooking was very rewarding and being better then you were yesterday is a great thing.
	Im passionate about getting better at things. And I am passionate about food. - Thats it.
	purpose is weird, I dont know
 From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,- I just want to be happy and not look back and think I wasted time.
 What are your core values? - Be on time, be respectful, workhard , know your place.
 What do you stand for? - I stand for beleiving that you are your only god. trust in youself and do what you want. 
 How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise? good, i felt better this week, not as many distractions 
 Any other musings?</p>
