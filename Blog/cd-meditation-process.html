<h1>questions</h1>
<p>
	How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild? - it was nice too follow a tutorial step by step instead of just copy and pasting the cheet sheet.
	 What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2? I was aware that its a great tool, and used to seek enlightenment
 What new things have you learnt about meditation? that meditation means to cultivate 
 Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you? yes, of course.  breathing to relax the mind is a great technique
 Any other musings? i should use more meditation in my life and find ways to make it relevent.
