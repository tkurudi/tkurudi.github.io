    What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
    To be mindfull is to be aware of your surroundings and other people, self awareness is to be aware of yourself, and how your actions or words my effect others. the relationship between both is that they work hand in hand and its importaint to use both in our lives in ballance 
    Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling).
     What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
      Journaling is a great tool, and I think it can help me a lot. Its good to see progression and to note dowm how I'm feeling at a certain time, and why im feeling a certain way. I think these are good tools because it helps to understand ill feelings and emotions.
   
    What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
   I personaly try to keep any emotions out of my daily life, Inknow if I'm feeling a certain way, that it will pass, or if it dosen't pass, I need to change something in my life. This section is just reaffirming how I like to run my life, just in different terms.
