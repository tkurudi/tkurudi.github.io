 Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling).
  What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
   Journaling is a great tool, and I think it can help me a lot. Its good to see progression and to note dowm how I'm feeling at a certain time, and why im feeling a certain way. I think these are good tools because it helps to understand ill feelings and emotions.

 What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
I personaly try to keep any emotions out of my daily life, Inknow if I'm feeling a certain way, that it will pass, or if it dosen't pass, I need to change something in my life. This section is just reaffirming how I like to run my life, just in different terms.</p>
