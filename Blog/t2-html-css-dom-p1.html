<P> The DOM is :Document Object Model. meaning it is the model or structure. It defines where and how the HTML sits. 
	the HTML is :Hypertext Markup Language. Its the main bones of a website. the basic blue print of how a website will look
CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. its the stlyling of the HTML, it makes things look nice and mordern. in refference to the 'bones' analogy Id say its like the skin, or the clothes. </P></div>
<div class="box questions">
	<h3>questions 2</h3>
	<p>boxifying is when you are anilizing a website, you break down all the main parts in to box's to make everything more basic and clear. its a good way to seperate the sections.
	the box model is used when taking about layout and designing websites,  the boc model is a box that wraps round every html element</p></div>
