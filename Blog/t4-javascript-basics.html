	How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS? javascript is more of a language, and has a lot of rules and different functions. youre able to maths, print setences to a consol, and much more
 Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition. If a given condition is true, we execute one block of code. If the statement is false, we execute another block of code. For instance, if we were making a game in which the user had to choose which door to enter, we'd need a way for the program to know what to do once the user was in the next room.

 Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.when eccessing data from an array you use the '[]' function and find the numbr that ='s the information you want. with an object you have to print the variable and the property to get its value
 Explain what functions are and why they are useful. you can code a whole seires of different statements into a function, then call on the function by name to be able to use it anywhere shorthand.
