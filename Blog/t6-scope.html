<h1>questions</h1>
<p> 
	what is scope?
	scope is a lot about what a user can use and what they can't based on either how they have defined a variable and also where they have declared it.
	In javscript there are two types of scope local and global
	variables declared within a JavaScript function become local to the function , since they are inside the function they can only accessed within that function.


	A variable declared outside a function, becomes global. it can be used from anywhere and by as many functions as you'd like.
