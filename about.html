                <P>
                    I am attending DEV Academy in OCT 2018. This is my first introduction into coding 
                    and computers in general. I am a trained cook, I have worked in a few great resaurants
                    and I am very interested in gastronomy. I look forward to making myself a better
                    coder and progressing everyday.
                </P>

            <p>
                    Worked for The Bresolin when it first opened. My duties were a 
                    larder chef. Operating the fryer and salad section. I had large 
                    amounts of prep in the mornings and afternoons followed by high
                     pace service in the nights. I learned plenty, working at 
                     The Bresolin, mainly because it was the first serious kitchen 
                     I worked for. I was taught about speed, cleanness, organization,
                      handling produce, making lists and ordering for my section.

                        108 is Noma's sister restaurant in Copenhagen, Denmark,
                        they were the number one restaurant in the world for 4 years.
                        I was lucky enough to work as an intern over a summer.
                        108 has a Michelin star and is a casual fine dining restaurant,
                        they use wild new techniques of cooking and help revolutionize
                        foraging for ingredients. I learned a lot at 108 and cherish my time there.
