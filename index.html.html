	<h1>This is a Heading</h1
	<p>this website contains my blog,
	Watch the broken common man
Drown his sorrows at unhappy hour
Dirty and sweaty with just enough to get by
Calluses on his hands, calluses on his soul
Hard-boiled, son of a bitch
Scraping away on the down hill grind
It's a means to an end, a mean end for most
Death and domestication ends in shattered hopes
Can't see the hand at the other end of the leash
Turn and bite, turn and bite the hand that bleeds you dry
Throw yourself a bone, no one else will
Compromise leads to self-loathing
Money the excrement of labor </p>
